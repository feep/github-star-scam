# How to scam 2,800 stars on GitHub.

## tl;dr

0. Take a project you own with 2,800 stars
1. Rename it to something completely unrelated
2. ???
3. Profit

That’s all it takes.

Eh, I don’t like it.

Will write more later.

thanks,

## Note:

I forked this repo to document the scam. GitHub does not allow me to hide a forked repo, so I edited the readme to add a note. I made no other changes. [Original `README.md` is here](./original_README.md).
